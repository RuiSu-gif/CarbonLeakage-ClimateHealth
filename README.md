# 🌍 CarbonLeakage-ClimateHealth
CarbonLeakage-ClimateHealth is an open-source repository accompanying the paper “Underestimated climate and health burden of carbon leakage”.

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides all scripts, configuration files, and workflows used in the study assessing how unintended carbon leakage in climate pledges amplifies global extreme heat–health inequities.  
The analysis integrates multiple components spanning emission modeling, climate response, temperature downscaling, and health impact assessment.

**Core components:**
1. **GCAM inputs** — simulation of regional NDC implementation and carbon leakage under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–SSP5).  
2. **OSCAR v3.2** — ensemble simulations quantifying temperature response, permafrost, and wildfire carbon feedbacks.  
3. **GMST-TST downscaling** — machine learning model reconstructing daily near-surface temperature fields at 1°×1° resolution from annual GSAT anomalies.  
4. **Heat-health analysis** — estimation of population exposure to heatwaves and assessment of inequality under different policy and leakage scenarios.
5. 
**Note:**
The data and files will be uploaded after the paper is accepted
